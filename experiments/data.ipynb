    "# IACT DL3 data handling in Gammapy\n",
    "\n",
    "The current IACT DL3 data handling and all analyses in Gammapy have some issues and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No support for 1D or 3D analysis in time intervals, only full runs\n",
    "- No support for event types\n",
    "- Poor support for pulsar PHASE selection (only for 1D, in background estimator)\n",
    "- No support for user-defined events selections (e.g. MC_ID)\n",
    "- Creating data selection (e.g. Crab) and making a copy is cumbersome (need to write code to make new index files)\n",
    "- One observation class that's a proxy to on-disk data, another for completely in-memory. Mix not supported (e.g. simulate events).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do 1D or 3D analysis for part of a run (say 1 minute)\n",
    "- Do 1D or 3D analysis for multiple runs (say 1 night or week)\n",
    "- Make GPS survey maps for CTA (process 10 GB of events data and 3000 runs)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What others have\n",
    "\n",
    "With Fermi-LAT, you always have gtselect and gtmktime at the start:\n",
    "https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/analysis/scitools/data_preparation.html\n",
    "Later tools (bin, fit) partly rely on \"data sub space\" DSS header keys for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ctools, every analysis starts with an \"observation definition file\" and also by running ctselect\n",

    "## Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The new scheme we propose is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The central class is `Observations`, that's the object passed to analysis classes like `MapMaker` or `SpectrumExtraction`.\n",
    "- `Observations` holds a of `Observation` objects\n",
    "- We leave the current `DataStore`, `HDUIndexTable` and `ObservationTable` classes alone,\n",
    "  they are one way to serialise observation definition information that we still support,\n",
    "  but moving forward we will develop something better (YAML).\n",
