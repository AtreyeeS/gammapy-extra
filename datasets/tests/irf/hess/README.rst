HESS IRF example files
======================

These are some HESS exported IRF files, for testing Gammapy IRF classes.
You are not allowed to use them for anything else!

Note that ``hess_events_023523.fits.gz`` is a simulated event list
generated with the scripts here, it's not HESS data!

The OGIP irf examples files are generated using a non-gammapy exporter (START)
